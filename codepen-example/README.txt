A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/teetteet/pen/tKqEs.

 This is an experiment with canvas trying to simulate chroma key effect, but without a green screen or a key color.

It works like Apple Photobooth, it takes a photo when you press the toggle button, and then set it as the key background.


Forked from [Mauricio Allende](http://codepen.io/mallendeo/)'s Pen [Testing Chroma Key](http://codepen.io/mallendeo/pen/CBnjK/).
